          Coffee day its just a random name that come up in my mind so i just thought it would be great to create a logo of it, I've been thinking of making a restaurant website for a very long time and building my own mini-restaunt , its one of my dream. Nowadays we can proudly boast our reputation for a well known Mexican restaurant with little bit of indian style food in our area. since there's no mexican indian style restaurant in my area i believe We can be famous for the fabulous authentic cuisine, professional chef and dedicated staff.
        </p>
        
         <p>
        The atmosphere of the restaurant will be unique and great.
        We offer you not only the best recipes of typical Mexican dishes, but you can also experience the taste of indian halal foods.
